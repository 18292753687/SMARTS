## Precompiled Binaries

The open_agent-X.XXX.whl files contained here are precompiled agent policies, these policy wheels can be rebuilt using `./setup.py` located in this same folder.

The purpose is for `./tests/test_open_agent.py` to have static policy binaries to test with.

Build the docs and see `docs/readme.rst:4.3.2 RLlib Example`.
